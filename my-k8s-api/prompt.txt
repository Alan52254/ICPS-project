| **Top‑K CPU**                | Show the top 3 CPU-consuming pods in the `default` namespace.                                            |
| **Top‑K Memory**             | List the top 5 memory-consuming pods in the `kube-system` namespace.                                     |
| **Single Pod CPU**           | Tell me the CPU usage of pod `nginx-6789df` in the `default` namespace over the past 30 minutes.         |
| **Single Pod Memory**        | Check the memory usage of pod `fluent-bit-0` in the `logging` namespace over the last 2 hours.           |
| **Summary in English**       | Summarize the top 3 memory-consuming pods in the `default` namespace in one sentence.                    |
| **Follow-up Question (CPU)** | After the previous answer, can you also give me their CPU usage?                                         |
| **Historical Comparison**    | Compare the top 3 CPU-heavy pods in the `default` namespace between now and 24 hours ago. What changed?  |
| **Optimization Suggestion**  | Based on the current CPU and memory data, suggest 2 pods that might need resource limit adjustments.     |
| **Health Check**             | Are there any pods in the `default` namespace with CPU or memory spikes? Give me a one-sentence summary. |
| **Educational / Teaching**   | What does the Prometheus query `container_memory_usage_bytes` represent? Explain it with an example.     |
